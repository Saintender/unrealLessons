header files and contracts

as before the header files are essentially the prototypes stored elsewhere

look into the naming conventions in order to settle on my own naming conventions

why do we include #pragma once
-ahh, only allows the header to be imported once

syntax: class FN{}

allowed a cpp/h pair

never use using namespace in headers
