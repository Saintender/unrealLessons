Magic Numbers and Constants

constexpr (Constant expression) is compiled at compile time
also not a variable type
this is a variable modifier

sets the value for a variable in the compiler and will not change during runtime

I wonder what the argument for the difference between constexpr vs const would be

strongest form of constant in cpp
